# üöó Smart Vehicle Accident Detection and Reporting System

This project is a smart, AI-powered web system designed to automatically detect vehicle accidents from CCTV footage and generate detailed accident reports using advanced deep learning models and the ChatGPT-4 API.

---

##  Project Objective

To revolutionize the traditional manual accident reporting process used by authorities such as **Najm** and insurance companies by automating the detection and reporting of traffic accidents.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

-  Detects vehicle accidents using CCTV images
-  Utilizes deep learning models: YOLOv7, SSD, Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet
-  Integrates GPT-4 API for automated report generation
-  User-friendly web interface built with Flask, HTML, and CSS
-  Reports include time, location, possible causes, recommendations, and more
